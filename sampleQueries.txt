-- DISTINCT Statement - Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
					-- So, if a value is present twice it returns only once.
select distinct author_lname from books;

-- ORDER BY -  The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
			-- The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
            -- Its Alpha numeric sorting.
select title from books order by title;
select title, author_lname, released_year from books order by released_year;
select title, author_lname, released_year from books order by 2; -- here 2 referes to 'author_lname'
select author_lname, title from books order by title desc;

-- LIMIT - MySQL provides a LIMIT clause that is used to specify the number of records to return.
select * from books limit 5; -- Return 5 items from the table
select * from books limit 3, 5; -- here 3 is the start index of the row and 5 is number elements to return from index 3;
								-- In my SQL 1st row index of the table is 0

-- LIKE - The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
		-- There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
				-- % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
				-- _ - The underscore represents a single character
select * from books;
select book_id, author_lname from books where author_lname like 'lahiri'; -- If are sure about the string we can use directly
select book_id, author_lname from books where author_lname like '%ah%'; -- If you arent pretty sure of string, search with partial characters
select book_id, author_lname from books where author_lname like '_ah%';
select book_id, author_lname from books where author_lname like '____ri%'; -- here each '_' represents one character
select book_id, author_lname from books where author_lname like '_a_i_i'; -- random characters match is also possible
	-- Now hoe do we select % or _ from a text
select title from books where title like '%\%%'; -- here '\' is an escape character
select title from books where title like '%\_%'; -- here '\' is an escape character

-- COUNT - The COUNT() function returns the number of records returned by a select query.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
select count(author_lname) from books;
select count(distinct author_lname) from books;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname, author_fname) FROM books; -- This returns distinct elements for both columns

-- GROUP_BY - The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
			-- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
select title, released_year from books group by released_year;
select title, released_year,count(released_year) from books group by released_year;
select title, released_year,count(released_year) from books group by released_year, author_lname; -- Return more unique data
select concat('In', released_year,count(*),' ','books are released') from books group by released_year;
SELECT CONCAT('In ', released_year, ' ', COUNT(released_year), ' book(s) released') AS year FROM books GROUP BY released_year;

select author_fname, min(released_year) from books group by author_fname;

    -- DOUBLE,

    -- DECIMAL - The first argument is precision, which is the number of total digits.

select name, birthdt, date_format(birthdt,'%D %M %Y') from birthdays; -- Format the date in which ever format we like
select name,birthdt, date_format(birthdt,'%H : %i : %S : %p') from birthdays; -- Grabbing time from column
	-- DATE MATH - We can add Months, years, Time anything to the data. More infor provided in MYSQL site under date and time functions
select datediff('1995-10-10 10:12:19', '1995-10-02'); -- Returns difference between dates
select datediff(now(), birthdt) from birthdays;

select * from comments2;
update comments2 set content =  'Ram is terrible!!' where content = 'praveen was very funny!!';-- Updated the data with latest timestamp

-- Logical Operators
	-- NOT EQUAL TO OPERATOR - works opposite to EQUALS OPERATOR
select title, author_fname from books where author_fname != 'Dave'; -- Returns all the columns which are not equal to 'Dave'
	-- NOT LIKE OPERATOR - works opposite to LIKE OPERATOR
select title, author_fname from books where author_fname not like '%av%'; -- Returns all the columns which are not like 'av'
	-- GREATER THAN OPERATOR
select title, released_year from books where released_year > 2000;
	-- GREATER THAN OR EQUAL OPERATOR
select title, released_year from books where released_year >=  2013;
select title, released_year from books where length(title) >=  25;
	-- Exercise on Greater than
select 100>5; -- Returns 1, which means true
select -15>15; -- Returns 0, which means false
select 1<1; -- Returns 0, which means false
select 1>1; -- Returns 0, which means false
select 'a'<'b';
select 'a'<'A'; -- Returns 0, which means false.In my sql string comparisions are not case sensitive
select 'a'<='A'; -- Returns 1, which means both are same

	-- AND OPERATOR (&& or AND)
select author_fname, released_year from books where author_fname = 'Dave' &&  released_year = 2012;
select author_fname, released_year from books where author_fname = 'Dave' AND  released_year = 2012;

	-- BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN OPERATOR
select title, released_year from books where released_year between 2005 and 2010;
select title, released_year from books where released_year >= 2005 &&  released_year <=2010; -- Works same as above
select title, released_year from books where released_year not between 2005 and 2010;
	-- IN OPERATOR
