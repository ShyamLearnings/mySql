A trigger is a set of actions that are run automatically when a specified change operation (SQL INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement)
is performed on a specified table. Triggers are useful for tasks such as enforcing business rules, validating input data, and
keeping an audit trail.

Uses for triggers:

Enforce business rules
Validate input data
Generate a unique value for a newly-inserted row in a different file.
Write to other files for audit trail purposes
Query from other files for cross-referencing purposes
Access system functions
Replicate data to different files to achieve data consistency
